1. GENERAL

  opencv_matlab is a simple C++ template library that provides routines 
  to convert between Matlab's and OpenCV's primary image representatations.

2. INSTALLATION

2.1 EXAMPLE FOR OpenCV CODE USING FUNCTIONS WRITTEN FOR C++-.mex FILES

  This demo uses OpenCV to load an image, then converts the image to Matlab's
  image representation, runs an arbitrary code, and then converts the result
  to OpenCV's format for further operations/display.

  You can compile it using cmake as follows:

    mkdir build
    ccmake ..
    make
    ./opencv_matlab_standalone path_to_some_test_image

  NOTE: Please do not send me e-mails regarding problems with OpenCV, etc. in
        general; I am really not the best person to answer such questions and 
        - in all honesty - I have too much other stuff to do, sorry.

2.2 EXAMPLE FOR CALLING OpenCV FUNCTIONS FROM A C++-.mex FILE
